"And in the end I think I've learned the final lesson from my travels in time; and I've even gone one step 
further than my father did: The truth is I now don't travel back at all, not even for the day, I just try 
to live every day as if I've deliberately come back to this one day, to enjoy it, as if it was the full 
final day of my extraordinary, ordinary life".  

It is true that today’s young people appear to be more socially engaged than kids have been for several 
decades and that they are more apt to harbor creative or entrepreneurial impulses. But it is also true, 
at least at the most selective schools, that even if those aspirations make it out of college—a big 
“if”—they tend to be played out within the same narrow conception of what constitutes a valid life: affluence, 
credentials, prestige. 

I used to think that we needed to create a world where every child had an equal chance to get to the elite 
universities. I’ve come to see that what we really need is to create one where you don’t have to go to the 
Ivy League, or any private college, to get a first-rate education.  

High-quality public education, financed with public money, for the benefit of all: the exact commitment that 
drove the growth of public higher education in the postwar years. Everybody gets an equal chance to go as far 
as their hard work and talent will take them—you know, the American dream. Everyone who wants it gets to have 
the kind of mind-expanding, soul-enriching experience that a liberal arts education provides. We also need to 
recognize—as we once did and as many countries still do—that the same is true of higher education.
