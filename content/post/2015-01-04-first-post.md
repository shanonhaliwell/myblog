"And in the end I think I've learned the final lesson from my travels in time; and I've even gone one step 
further than my father did: The truth is I now don't travel back at all, not even for the day, I just try 
to live every day as if I've deliberately come back to this one day, to enjoy it, as if it was the full 
final day of my extraordinary, ordinary life".
